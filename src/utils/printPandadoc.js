          and billed to the Client at a rate of{" "}
          <span class="token">[Rate]</span> per hour for any assistance
          thereafter. The Developer agrees to respond to any reasonable request

        </li>
        <li>
          Except as expressly provided in this Software Development Agreement,
          the Client shall not be obligated under this Agreement to provide any
          further support or assistance to the Developer.

      <h2>2. Delivery</h2>
      <p>
        The Software shall function in accordance with the Specifications on or
        before the Delivery Date.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          If the Software as delivered does not conform with the Specifications,
          the Client shall within <span class="token">[Time frame]</span> of the
          Delivery Date notify the Developer in writing of the ways on which it
          does not conform with the Specifications. The Developer agrees that
          upon receiving such notice, it shall make reasonable efforts to

        Developer shall confer and the Client may either withdraw the proposed
        change or require the Developer to deliver the Software with the
        proposed change and subject to the delay and/or additional expense. The
        Client agrees and acknowledges that the judgment regarding any delay or
        additional expense shall be made solely by the Developer.

          For a period of <span class="token">[Time frame]</span> after the
